<h3>Dealing with Account Lockouts</h3>
<p>
  
  Get logged into DC-1 VM,
  
 Pick a random user account we created previously 
 
 – *User*: **"BODI-VOBA"**

Account Lockout Policy is not set in Active Directory. 

To do so, type "**gpmc.msc**" in Run (Windows key + R or Search for "Run"), right-click an existing GPO, and select Edit to modify it.

Then we'll Configure Group Policy to lock out the account after **5** attempts:

</p>
<p>
  
  Log in to Client-1 as Domain Admin “Jane Doe” to force the PC to update the policy quickly using the command prompt.

  Use the command `gpupdate /force`
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Sign out of Client-1 VM and attempt to log in with it 6 times with a bad password. 
  
  After 5 times, the Client-1 VM should lock you out on the 6th attempt for that user's account.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s6jgOCa.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  
  Observe that the account has been locked out within **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**, it says 
  
  "*This Account is currently Locked out on this Active Directory Domain Controller!*"
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x8n0WiM.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  
  Now let's unlock the account. Check "**Unlock Account**", then click **Apply** & **OK**.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Now the user can log into the Client-1 VM.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Password Reset</h3>
<p>
  
  After the failed login attempts, you could reset the Password for the end-user here.

  Set a temporary password for the end-user that complies with the company's password policy.

  Right-click the user and select the "**Reset Password**" option. Then, attempt to log in with it.
</p>
<p>
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2py9SSb.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  You must also be sure to check the highlighted boxes to ensure the user’s account is unlocked and enable them to set their own password rather than the temporary one. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  To provide excellent customer service for the end-user, be sure to 

  - Communicate the temporary password to the end-user through a secure channel and instruct them to change it immediately upon login, ensuring that the new password is strong and complies with the company's password policy, and not to forget it.
    
  - Provide guidance on how to change the password using the company's self-service password reset tool if available.
    
  - Document the date and time of account creation for auditing purposes.
</p>

<h3>Enabling and Disabling Accounts</h3>
<p>
  
  Disable the same account in **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xa2gLNW.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Attempt to log in with it, and observe the error message,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AOLT2lx.png" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  
  Then, **re-enable** the account and attempt to log in.
</p>

</p>
<br />

<h3>Observe Logs</h3>
<p>
Observe the logs on the Client-1 VM,
  
Log in as the user "**bodi.voba**"

Type “eventvwr.msc” in the search bar.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  We can’t see Log Events as a normal user. Open as Administrator, and sign in as the Domain Admin, Jane Doe. 
  
  We can still log in even though we’re signed in as someone else.

<p>
  Here you can view events from Windows Logs.
